# SQL
Some Random SQL... 

The Northwind database is a sample database that was originally created by Microsoft and used as the basis for their tutorials in a variety of database products for decades. The Northwind database contains sales data for a fictitious company called “Northwind Traders,” which imports and exports specialty foods from around the world. 

I wrote some PostgreSQL querries to explore this database.

Also included here is a similar exercise, only this time using the "Classic Models" database and MySQL.
