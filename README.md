# SQL
Some Random PostgreSQL 

The Northwind database is a sample database that was originally created by Microsoft and used as the basis for their tutorials in a variety of database products for decades. The Northwind database contains sales data for a fictitious company called “Northwind Traders,” which imports and exports specialty foods from around the world. 

I wrote some SQL querries to explore this database.
